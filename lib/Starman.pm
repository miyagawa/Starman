=head1 NAME

Starman - High-performance preforking PSGI/Plack web server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Run app.psgi with the default settings
  > starman

  # run with Server::Starter
  > start_server --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- starman --workers 32 myapp.psgi

  # UNIX domain sockets
  > starman --listen /tmp/starman.sock

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Starman is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

=over 4

=item High Performance

Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

=item Preforking

Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers
do. Starman also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the
worker pool.

=item Signals

Supports C<HUP> for graceful worker restarts, and C<TTIN>/C<TTOU> to
dynamically increase or decrease the number of worker processes, as
well as C<QUIT> to gracefully shutdown the worker processes.

=item Superdaemon aware

Supports L<Server::Starter> for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

=item Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support

Able to listen on multiple intefaces including UNIX sockets.

=item Small memory footprint

Preloading the applications with C<--preload-app> command line option
enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum
memory usage Starman requires for the master process is 7MB and
children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

=item PSGI compatible

Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

=item HTTP/1.1 support

Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline requests.

=item UNIX only

This server does not support Win32.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Here's a simple benchmark using C<Hello.psgi>.

  -- server: Starman (workers=10)
  Requests per second:    6849.16 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: Twiggy
  Requests per second:    3911.78 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: AnyEvent::HTTPD
  Requests per second:    2738.49 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
  Requests per second:    2218.16 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI (workers=10)
  Requests per second:    2792.99 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: HTTP::Server::Simple
  Requests per second:    1435.50 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: Corona
  Requests per second:    2332.00 [#/sec] (mean)
  -- server: POE
  Requests per second:    503.59 [#/sec] (mean)

This benchmark was processed with C<ab -c 10 -t 1 -k> on MacBook Pro
13" late 2009 model on Mac OS X 10.6.2 with perl 5.10.0. YMMV.

=head1 NAMING

=head2 Starman?

The name Starman is taken from the song (I<Star na Otoko>) by the
Japanese rock band Unicorn (yes, Unicorn!). It's also known as a song
by David Bowie, a power-up from Super Mario Brothers and a character
from Earthbound, all of which I love.

=head2 Why the cute name instead of more descriptive namespace? Are you on drugs?

I'm sick of naming Perl software like
HTTP::Server::PSGI::How::Its::Written::With::What::Module and people
call it HSPHIWWWM on IRC. It's hard to say on speeches and newbies
would ask questions what they stand for every day. That's crazy.

This module actually includes the longer alias and an empty subclass
L<HTTP::Server::PSGI::Net::Server::PreFork> for those who like to type
more ::'s. It would actually help you find this software by searching
for I<PSGI Server Prefork> on CPAN, which i believe is a good thing.

Yes, maybe I'm on drugs. We'll see.

L<Server::Starter> support to this software.

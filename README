NAME
    Starman - High-performance preforking PSGI/Plack web server

SYNOPSIS
      # Run app.psgi with the default settings
      > starman

      # run with Server::Starter
      > start_server --port 127.0.0.1:80 -- starman --workers 32 myapp.psgi

      # UNIX domain sockets
      > starman --listen /tmp/starman.sock

DESCRIPTION
    Starman is a PSGI perl web server that has unique features such as:

    High Performance
        Uses the fast XS/C HTTP header parser

    Preforking
        Spawns workers preforked like most high performance UNIX servers do.
        Starman also reaps dead children and automatically restarts the
        worker pool.

    Signals
        Supports "HUP" for graceful worker restarts, and "TTIN"/"TTOU" to
        dynamically increase or decrease the number of worker processes, as
        well as "QUIT" to gracefully shutdown the worker processes.

    Superdaemon aware
        Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.

    Multiple interfaces and UNIX Domain Socket support
        Able to listen on multiple intefaces including UNIX sockets.

    Small memory footprint
        Preloading the applications with "--preload-app" command line option
        enables copy-on-write friendly memory management. Also, the minimum
        memory usage Starman requires for the master process is 7MB and
        children (workers) is less than 3.0MB.

    PSGI compatible
        Can run any PSGI applications and frameworks

    HTTP/1.1 support
        Supports chunked requests and responses, keep-alive and pipeline
        requests.

    UNIX only
        This server does not support Win32.

PERFORMANCE
    Here's a simple benchmark using "Hello.psgi".

      -- server: Starman (workers=10)
      Requests per second:    6849.16 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: Twiggy
      Requests per second:    3911.78 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: AnyEvent::HTTPD
      Requests per second:    2738.49 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI
      Requests per second:    2218.16 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::PSGI (workers=10)
      Requests per second:    2792.99 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: HTTP::Server::Simple
      Requests per second:    1435.50 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: Corona
      Requests per second:    2332.00 [#/sec] (mean)
      -- server: POE
      Requests per second:    503.59 [#/sec] (mean)

    This benchmark was processed with "ab -c 10 -t 1 -k" on MacBook Pro 13"
    late 2009 model on Mac OS X 10.6.2 with perl 5.10.0. YMMV.

NAMING
  Starman?
    The name Starman is taken from the song (*Star na Otoko*) by the
    Japanese rock band Unicorn (yes, Unicorn!). It's also known as a song by
    David Bowie, a power-up from Super Mario Brothers and a character from
    Earthbound, all of which I love.

  Why the cute name instead of more descriptive namespace? Are you on drugs?
    I'm sick of naming Perl software like
    HTTP::Server::PSGI::How::Its::Written::With::What::Module and people
    call it HSPHIWWWM on IRC. It's hard to say on speeches and newbies would
    ask questions what they stand for every day. That's crazy.

    This module actually includes the longer alias and an empty subclass
    HTTP::Server::PSGI::Net::Server::PreFork for those who like to type more
    ::'s. It would actually help you find this software by searching for
    *PSGI Server Prefork* on CPAN, which i believe is a good thing.

    Yes, maybe I'm on drugs. We'll see.
